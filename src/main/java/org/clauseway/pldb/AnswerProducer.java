 * The seam's ASYNC kind — the primary kind for anything that computes or
 * fetches: a source IS the produce function from a call key to an emission
 * of answers, and COMPLETION IS THE SEAL. The workforce runs on the
 * CALLER's scheduler: no source owns a driver, forked work continues while
 * the source prepares results elsewhere, and an examination that parks
 * waits on its own branch only. The over-delivery law is unchanged: emit
 * every answer matching the probe (the region is advisory), never fewer.
 *
 * <p>The sync {@link AnswerSource} lifts into this kind at the composition
 * point ({@link #of} — the two-lane doctrine's one legal direction); the
 * fiber kind never masquerades as sync.
