/**
 * The composite {@link Pin}: every probed region paired with the pin
 * its source minted — the name of the WORLD-VECTOR a body of work
 * read. A base read's pin is a leaf; a derived producer's pin is the
 * {@link #union} of its parts' footprints; the transaction's footprint
 * is the same type at the top. The carrier never interprets leaves —
 * {@link #union} only compares them per region, and overlapping
 * regions carrying UNEQUAL pins refuse with {@link Transaction.Conflict}:
 * composing reads of two different worlds IS the conflict the commit
 * door speaks, met at composition instead of commit.
 * An empty footprint certifies vacuously: a decision that stood on no
 * reads cannot have stood on stale ones.
