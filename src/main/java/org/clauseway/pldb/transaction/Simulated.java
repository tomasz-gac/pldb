/**
 * SIMULATED serialization: this transaction's ledger is the read cache
 * AND the recorder in one — a region's FIRST touch reads through the
 * source (pin and rows minted from one world) and every repeat serves
 * the same {@link Pinned} back, so the transaction is its own snapshot
 * at region grain: read stability by construction, no source consulted
 * twice for one region. Commit proves the {@link #footprint()} of its
 * own reads UNIONED with the {@link #requiring(Footprint) premise} —
 * regions a client read in an EARLIER request, whose decision this
 * write carries out: the commit stands on both, and either world
 * having moved refuses it. The union's own refusal guards overlapping
 * regions read at different worlds.
