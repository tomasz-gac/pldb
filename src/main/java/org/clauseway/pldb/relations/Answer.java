/**
 * One row of data, whole: the {@link Relation} it belongs to, its reified
 * image — a ground cell is a value, a free cell an Any (the ∀-schema
 * marking) — and the {@link Condition} it holds under, ground facts at
 * {@link Condition#ONE}. Every consumer speaks this shape: a query
 * reads it (typed access via {@link #get}), a persist lands it, a
 * retract removes it — with the WRITE doors refusing wide cells and
 * guarded conditions; reads keep the richness. {@link #of(Relation, Tuple2)}
 * and {@link #tuple()} cross the boundary to the tabling cell's pair
 * vocabulary, where the relation is the cell's context.
