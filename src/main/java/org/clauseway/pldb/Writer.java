/**
 * A value that accepts writes. The PRIMITIVE doors speak {@link Answer}
 * rows — the one data currency — and own the strictness: a wide cell
 * refuses by relation and column, a guarded row refuses toward the
 * explicit choice ({@link Answer#unconditional()}). The {@link Literal}
 * doors are the statement face: minted by the schema functions,
 * converted at the threshold ({@link Literal#fact()} refuses holes),
 * always ground and unconditional by construction. {@link #retracting}
 * removes BY FACT — the membership claim leaves whole, every physical
 * duplicate with it; retracting the absent is a set-semantics no-op at
 * a store, and a transaction that both asserts and retracts one fact
 * refuses loudly: it has not decided what it believes.
