/**
 * Compiles one constraint atom into the adapter's predicate vocabulary.
 * Registered on a source per FACTOR CLASS, so user-created constraint
 * families push down without the adapter enumerating them; an unregistered
 * family simply stays local — silence, not error.
 *
 * <p>THE ONE LAW: the compiled predicate must be entailed by the atom —
 * weaker or equal, never stronger. A predicate that selects fewer rows
 * than the atom admits makes the source under-deliver, and lost answers
 * are silent. Returning {@link Optional#empty()} for anything uncertain
 * is always correct: the atom's narrowing stays local, enforced by
 * propagation over the returned rows.
 *
 * <p>Atoms name the probe's frees by their reified terms; the resolver
 * answers with the column(s) the term OCCUPIES IN THE IMAGE, and ground
 * terms with nothing — a compiler reads its operands through it and
 * never sees tables. A coupled variable occupies several columns:
 * {@link ColumnResolver#columnsOf} lists them all, and conjoining a
 * constraint across every occurrence is lawful — rows disagreeing
 * between coupled columns are never valid answers, so the conjunct
 * drops only what the local coupling filter would drop.
