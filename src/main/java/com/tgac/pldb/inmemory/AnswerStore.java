/**
 * The in-memory store, native to the seam's vocabulary. Its semantics
 * is MEMBERSHIP, and only membership: a row is the claim "this image
 * belongs to this relation, under this condition" — monotone and
 * direction-free, so answers join their relation's rows wherever the
 * probe that fetched them was narrow or wide, a wide row is the
 * ∀-schema claim over its frees, and a duplicate image ⊕-folds its
 * conditions (membership holds if EITHER derivation's guard does;
 * image equality is alpha-equivalence). The two claims the store
 * deliberately cannot speak live beside it: "these are ALL the rows
 * matching a probe" is COVERAGE's, and "this extension, as of this
 * world" is the PIN's — writes here never assert either.
 *
 * <p>The RELATION's declared access pattern is the index spec: columns
 * flagged {@code indexed()} keep per-value buckets in Term vocabulary
 * (null is a key; a row free at an indexed column lives in the
 * wildcard set, matching every probe); {@link #answers} intersects the
 * ground indexed positions' buckets and filters the remaining bound
 * positions. An unflagged relation full-scans, correctly. Residues
 * are ignored under the standing license — a source may only
 * over-deliver, and here over-delivery costs a walk.
 * Couplings between frees are likewise over-delivered; the consumer's
 * restate filters. The value is PERSISTENT: every insert mints a new
 * store, ancestors keep answering as before — which is why the
 * inherited object-identity {@link #id()} is right: each value IS its
 * data (same object, same extension — the sound direction), and a
 * store playing the shared-backend role gets its declared name from
 * the HANDLE that shares it, never from the value.
